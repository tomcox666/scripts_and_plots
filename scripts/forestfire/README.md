**Title: Forest Fire Simulation with Firebreaks and Wind Dynamics**

**Purpose**
This Python script simulates the spread of a forest fire, taking into account these factors:

* Tree Density: The likelihood of a forest cell containing a tree.
* Firebreaks: Gaps within the forest designed to slow down or stop fire spread.
* Wind Speed & Direction: Environmental factors that influence the rate and direction of fire spread.

**Prerequisites**

* Python 3: You'll need a Python 3 environment set up. Basic familiarity with Python is assumed.
* Libraries:  The following libraries are required:
* NumPy: Provides numerical array functionality. (https://numpy.org/)
* Matplotlib: Used for creating visualizations and animations. (https://matplotlib.org/)

**Installation Instructions**

1. Libraries: Ensure you have NumPy and Matplotlib installed. This can typically be done using the pip package manager:
    `pip install numpy matplotlib`

**Running the Simulation**

2. Download: Download the Python script (name it forest_fire_simulation.py) and save it to your computer.

3. Execution: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script is stored. Run the script using the following command:

    `python forest_fire_simulation.py`

4. Inputs: The script will prompt you for two pieces of information:

* Wind Speed (mph): Enter a numerical value for wind speed, or press Enter for no wind.
* Wind Direction (N, E, S, W): Enter the cardinal direction of the wind or press Enter for no wind.
* Visualization:  The script will generate an animated visualization showing the progress of the fire, including how the firebreaks and wind influence its spread.

**Script Explanation**

**Key Functions:**

* `initialize_forest(size, density, firebreak_freq, firebreak_width)`: This function sets up the initial forest.

* `size`: Determines the square dimensions of the forest.
* `density`: Controls the probability of a cell having a tree.
* `firebreak_freq`: How often spaces for firebreaks are created within the forest grid.
* `firebreak_width`: The probability that an empty cell along a firebreak line is actually converted into a firebreak.
* `simulate_fire(forest, fire_prob, wind_speed, wind_dir, firebreak_prob, spread_over_gap_prob, max_steps)`:  This function handles the core logic of the fire spread.

* `forest`: The current state of the grid.
* `fire_prob`: The base probability of fire spreading from a burning tree to an adjacent one.
* `wind_speed`, wind_dir: Affect the likelihood of fire spreading in the specified direction.
* `firebreak_prob`: The likelihood of firebreaks successfully stopping the fire spread.
* `spread_over_gap_prob`: A small chance that the fire can jump across a firebreak.
* `max_steps`: Maximum simulation iterations.
* `visualize_fire(fire_progress, wind_speed, wind_dir)`: This function uses Matplotlib to generate an animation of the fire simulation.

**Customization**

You can modify the parameters within the script (such as  size, density, fire_prob) to experiment with different forest and fire scenarios.
